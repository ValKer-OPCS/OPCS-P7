## ðŸ“– Project Description

Kasa is a real estate rental web application.  
The goal of this project is to build its **front-end** using **React** and **React Router**, based on the mockups provided in the project brief.  

The application allows users to:  
- Browse a catalog of properties on the **Home page**  
- View details of each property on a **Housing page**  
- Access general information on the **About page**  
- See a **404 error page** for invalid routes  

The project focuses exclusively on **front-end development**.  
Data is simulated and comes from a local **JSON file** instead of a back-end API.  
The interface is styled with **SASS**, and includes **CSS animations** for a smooth user experience.  
Project setup is done with **Vite** to keep development fast and simple.  


## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Build the front-end of an application with **React**
- Use **React Router** for navigation between pages
- Create reusable **React components**
- Apply **SASS** for styling

- Work with data from a **JSON file**
- Run the app locally with **Node.js** and **Vite**
